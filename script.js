// Task 1: creating a variable declaration and initialization.
let age = 2; // Number type
let name = "Tehillah Ojo"; // String type
let isStudent = true;// Boolean type

//logging values and types to the console.
console.log("Age:", age, "-Type:", typeof age);
console.log("Name:", name, "-Type:", typeof name);
console.log("isStudent:", isStudent, "-Type:", typeof isStudent)



//Task 2: Arithmetic Operations
//creating variable a nad b and assigning values to them.
let a = 4;
let b = 8;
//performing arithmetic operations and storing the results in new variables.
let c = a + b; //Addition
let d = b - a; //Subtraction
let e = a * b; //Multiplication
let f = a / b; //Division
//logging the results of the operations to console
console.log(c, d, e, f)



//Task 3: Creating variables and assigning Comparison Operators to them.
let x = 9
let y = "16"
console.log(x == y);
console.log(x === y);
console.log(x != y);
console.log(x !== y);
console.log(x > y);
console.log(x < y);
console.log(x >= y);
console.log(x <= y);



//Task 4: Creating variables and assigning them to Coercion 
let numberString = "10"
let actualNumber = 5
//logging the Coercion to a console
console.log(numberString + actualNumber);
console.log(numberString - actualNumber);
console.log(numberString * actualNumber);
console.log(numberString / actualNumber)
